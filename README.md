# Predictive-Signal-on-Crypto-Currency

Project during my 4th year at ESILV in collaboration with HKML research 
We explored the data collection by scrapping it, we tried NLP over sites such as Coin Telegraph, and we implement a strategy with RSI MACD Choppiness index and NLP then backtest it 

The objective is to look at the predictive signal on the cryptocurrency market.
We learned a lot from this project but we didn't assume the market-neutral probability
